Powerpoint Notes:

- Progress
	- MCTS w/o adjustment for max raise
	- MCTS adjusted max raise
	- MCTS basic heuristic
	- MCTS more in-depth heuristic (how many players in game; heuristic value -> actions)
	- MCTS final heuristic (keeping track of cards and opponent bets)

- Data Collection:


	- Us vs Random/Honest/Emulator
		- 10, 25, 50, 100 # of rounds
		- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (# of Total Players)
		- 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000

	
	- Length of Game
		- How well does agent perform with increasing number of rounds?


	- Number of Players
		- How well does our playout evaluation do with more players in game?

	
	- Number of Playouts
		- How many playouts give agent optimal decision-making without sacrificing performance?


	- Skill of Opponents?
		- Constant # of Opponents
		- How well do we perform against skilled opponents?
			- Random vs Honest vs Emulator
			- If time, US (Console Player)
